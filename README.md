# User Authentication API

This project is a User Authentication API built using Express.js and MongoDB. It allows users to register, log in, and search for other users securely. Passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt, and JWT tokens are used to handle authentication and protect user data. The API includes proper validation and error handling to ensure data integrity and security.
